# Weather-Scatter-Diagram-
A graph, created using the Bokeh Python library, that allows us to visualize statistical data.
The data in this case shows the temperature (Â°C) and pressure (hPA) changes throughout the day from the year 2010 to 2014 in a Country in Europe.
This information is represented in a scatter plot. 
The reason we divide each instance of the temp and pressure by 10 is bc they both have a scale factor of 10. It is therefore done to ensure accurate visualization.

NB: The output file is 'Weather.html'
